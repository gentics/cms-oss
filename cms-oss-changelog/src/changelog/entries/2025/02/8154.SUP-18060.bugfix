Administrator User Interface: The behaviour of cancelling the publish process has been improved.
The UI will now wait for up to 10 seconds for the publish process to stop. If the publish process is
still running after 10 seconds, a warning will be shown and stack traces of all publisher related threads will
be logged to the server log.
