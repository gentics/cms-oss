h2. How to use the Oracle MySQL instead of the MariaDB JDBC connector

endprologue.

The <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/" target="_blank">Oracle MySQL</a> and the <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/about-mariadb-connector-j/" target="_blank">MariaDB JDBC</a> connectors are already included in the CMS package.

Since version 5.29.0, <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/about-mariadb-connector-j/" target="_blank">MariaDB Connector/J</a> is the default connector for MySQL.
However you can change the following setting to let the CMS use the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/" target="_blank">Oracle MySQL JDBC connector</a> instead by setting the environment variable @NODE_DB_DRIVER_CLASS@, the Java system property @com.gentics.contentnode.db.driverClass@ or the following setting in a .yml configuration file:

<shell filename="conf/*.yml>
db:
	settings:
		driverClass: "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
</shell>
