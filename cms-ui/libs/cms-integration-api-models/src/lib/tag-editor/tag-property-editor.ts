 * 1. `ngOnInit()`
 * 2. `initTagPropertyEditor()`
 * 3. `registerOnChange()`
 *
 * Whenever the user changes the `TagProperty` assigned to this editor (which may cause the editor to change
 * other TagProperties as well), the `TagPropertyEditor` has to call the `TagPropertiesChangedFn` to inform the
 * TagEditor about the changes. The TagEditor will then validate the changes and make the onChange function
 * return the validation results.
 * During the execution of the `onChange` function the TagEditor copies all valid changes to a partial
 * TagPropertyMap and communicates them to all other TagPropertyEditors through their `writeChangedValues()` method.
 * The source `TagPropertyEditor` does not get a `writeChangedValues()` call.
 *
 * The decision for the appropriate times to call the `TagPropertiesChangedFn` is up to each `TagPropertyEditor`,
 * but the `TagPropertiesChangedFn` must be called at the latest when the `TagPropertyEditor` component loses focus.
 *
 * The `TagPropertyEditor` may perform tag validation by itself as well. This must however, not influence the calls
 * to the `TagPropertiesChangedFn`, i.e. user input values that fail validation must also be passed to it, so that
 * the `TagEditor` knows that the currently displayed value is invalid.
 *
 * All objects passed to any of the methods of the `TagPropertyEditor` interface are deep copies created by the `TagEditor`,
 * so they may be safely modified by the `TagPropertyEditor`.
