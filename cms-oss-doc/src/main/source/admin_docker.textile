h4. Volumes

|_.Volume path |_.Description             |
| /Node/node   | Binary database files and files that should be persisted, should be mount as named Docker volume |

h3. Kubernetes / Openshift

The CMS docker image can also be used with a Kubernetes or Openshift pod. Running the container with a random user ID and group ID 0 is supported (Openshift policies support). All folders that should be writable are owned by the group ID 0 and are group writable.

Note: It might be necessary to configure the port of the internal Apache Http Server to a non-privileged port (e.g. 8080) by using the environment variable _APACHE_PORT_ when running the container in Openshift.

h3. Updating

Updating to a newer version normally doesn't require any special actions besides changing the image tag.

h4. From 5.35.x to 5.36.x

When updating from a version older than 5.36.x, you have to consider the following things:

* The group for writable folders has changed to 0 (root) in order to support Openshift.
* sudo has been removed. Please change any custom scripts or scheduler tasks to not use sudo anymore.
* cron has been replaced by the more container friendly "supercronic"
* All processes are running with the "node" user now. Apache 2 was previously executed with the "www-data" user.
* The container can be run with any User ID for the "node" user now (Openshift support)

If the container runs with a different User ID after updating, please run the following commands:

<shell>
	chown -R 1000:0 /Node/node
	chmod -R u+rwX,g+rwX,o-w /Node/node
</shell>

If you also have mounted other volumes than /Node/node (e.g.: /var/log/, ...), the above also has to be done for these.
