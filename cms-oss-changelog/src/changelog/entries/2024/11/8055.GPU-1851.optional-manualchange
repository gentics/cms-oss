Object property definitions now have a boolean flag "restricted" which can be set to restrict object properties to assigned Nodes.
When updating an older CMS instance, the "restricted" flag will be automatically set to object property definitions, which are already
restricted to Nodes. All other object property definitions remain globally available.
It is recommended to check the restriction settings of all existing object property definitions after the update.
