h3. Configuration

The CACHECLEAR_THRESHOLD parameter can be used to change the cache clear behavior.

Normally, the dirting process will clear the cache for modified object, one by one.

This process can be very time consuming. The CACHECLEAR_THRESHOLD setting can be used to define a threshold upon which a global cache clear is invoked.
Instead of multiple small cache clears the whole cache invocations will be cleared in one single step.

It is suggested to experiment with this setting in order to determine the optimal value.

<javascript filename="conf/*.yml">
	# Define the threshold for the cache clear events.
	# -1 means no global cache clear will be invoked. (Old behavior)
	#  0 means to always clear the whole cache
cacheclear_threshold: 10000
</javascript>
