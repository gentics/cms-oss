/**
 * Instances of class PropertyResolver can resolve properties by paths based on
 * a single Resolvable object. The resolving process is done iteratively for
 * each part of the property path as long as each property is a Resolvable
 * itself.<br>Example: Let the base object be a Resolvable representing a
 * User. A call to {@link #resolve(String)} with "organisation.name" would first
 * call {@link Resolvable#get(String)} with "organisation" on the base object.
 * If and only if the return value is again a Resolvable (representing the
 * organisation of the user) the resolving process would continue by calling
 * {@link Resolvable#get(String)} with "name" on the organisation object. The
 * return value of this call would be the final value, since "name" is the last
 * part of the property path.<br><br>The resolving process is also capable
 * of resolving multivalue properties:<br> Let's expand the example above in
 * the following way: The base object again is the user, and the call to
 * {@link #resolve(String)} is done with "organisation.employees.email".
 * Resolving of "organisation" gives a single {@link Resolvable} representing
 * the user's organisation. The property "employees" shall be a
 * {@link Collection} of {@link Resolvable}s representing all users of the
 * organisation. The resolving process would now continue by iterating over the
 * {@link Collection} and get the property "email" for each {@link Resolvable}.
 * So the final return value would be a {@link Collection} of all email
 * addresses of all users of the base user's organisation.<br><br> The
 * PropertyResolver has also static variants of the resolve methods that get another
 * base object to start resolving. If one of those methods is used, the default
 * base object is ignored and the given startObject is used instead.
