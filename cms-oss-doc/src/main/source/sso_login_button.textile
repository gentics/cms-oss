h3. Customer Config

All customer-specific configuration and code should reside in the customer-config directory which should be a sibling of the ui folder. The structure of this folder should be as follows:

<shell>
<webserver root>/
|
|- ui/  # the GCMS UI
|
|- customer-config/
    |
    |- config/
    |   |
    |   |- ui-overrides.json
    |
    |- scripts/
        |
        |- index.js
</shell>

h3. The overrides.json file

A simple JSON file with one single object is needed to configure the Single Sign On button:

<shell>
{
  "showSSOButton": true
}
</shell>

If showSSOButton is set to 'true', then the login page contains a Single Sign On button in addition to the login credentials form.
If showSSOButton is set to 'false' (and Single Sign On is enabled), then Single Sign On will happen automatically and no login screen will be shown.
