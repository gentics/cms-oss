Administrator User Interface: Several issues with the node properties dialog have been fixed:
* The checkbox "Publish Directory Segments" will now only be visible, when the feature pub_dir_segments is activated.
* The checkbox "Publish Directory Segments" will be disabled for channels, since this setting is inherited from the master node.
