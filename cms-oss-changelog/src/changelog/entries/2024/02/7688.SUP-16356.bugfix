Copying or moving a page into another node will no longer be possible, if the page has variants in languages,
which are not activated in the target node. The only exception is when copying or moving a page with a single language
into a node, that does not have languages at all (in this case, the target page will also have no language) or when
copying or moving a page without a language into a node with languages (the target node will get the first assigned language
of the target node).
