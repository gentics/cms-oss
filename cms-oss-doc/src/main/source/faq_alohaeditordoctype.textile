h2. Which Doctype should be used with Aloha Editor?

Because Aloha Editor is an HTML5 Editor, we strongly suggest to 
stick to using a HTML5 Doctype.

If the Doctype declaration is missing UI Components such as the 
draggable toolbar might be missing. Always add a valid HTML5
Doctype declaration to your code:

<html>
<!DOCTYPE html>
</html>
