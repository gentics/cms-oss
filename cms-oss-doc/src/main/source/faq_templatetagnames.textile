h3. Limitations

Template tags with non ASCCI characters in the name may cause problems when being used within a tagmap entry. The mapname of a tagmap entry will be resolved. Characters like "-" or "+" will be evaluate like arithmetic operators. It is therefore suggested to not use such characters.

Example:
<shell>
	<node name-of-the-tag>
</shell>
