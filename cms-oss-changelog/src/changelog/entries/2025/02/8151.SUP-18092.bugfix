The default log level for the logger 'org.eclipse.jetty' has been changed to 'warn' to log errors
that occur in servlet filters (e.g. used for single-sign-on).
This change will only take effect, if no custom nodelog.yml file is present. If a custom nodelog.yml file
is used, it is recommended to set the log level of 'org.eclipse.jetty' to at least 'warn' there.
