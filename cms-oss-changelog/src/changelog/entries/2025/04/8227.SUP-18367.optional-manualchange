The implementation for the REST model @Construct@ was changed:

* The methods @isOpenEditorOnInsert()@ and @isEditorControlsInside()@ have been renamed to @getOpenEditorOnInsert()@ and @getEditorControlsInside()@ respectively.
* The methods @getOpenEditorOnInsert()@ and @getEditorControlsInside()@ now return @Boolean@ instead of @boolean@ and can therefore return @null@.
