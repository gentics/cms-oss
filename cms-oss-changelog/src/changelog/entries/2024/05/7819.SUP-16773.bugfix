The publish process will now check whether the dirtqueue worker thread is alive before waiting for dirtqueue events to be handled.
If the dirtqueue worker is found to not be alive, a restart will be attempted. After 5 failed attempts, the publish process will fail.
This resolves endlessly hanging publish processes, when the dirtqueue worker thread died before.
