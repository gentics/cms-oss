h3. Configuration

If you want to use this feature, you first have to enable it globally in your node.conf

<shell filename="conf/features.yml">
feature:
  disable_instant_delete: true
</shell>

After that, you can enable it per node in the nodes' "Features" dialogues (which can be found either in a node's context menu or in Node â€“ Features).
