h2. Where can I see rendering errors in Aloha Editor?

When rendering a page in preview or edit mode using Aloha Editor,
the assistant bar is hidden. Rendering errors - which were usually
shown in the assistant bar, are now logged using Aloha Editors Log methods.

The default implementation of the Aloha Logging logs into the Javascript Console.
Therefore, rendering messages will be logged into the Javascript Console too.
The log level of Aloha can be modified on the server changing log4j settings
as specified:

<shell filename="conf/nodelog.yml">
Configuration:
  ...
  Loggers:
    logger:
      -
        name: com.gentics.aloha
        level: error
</shell>
