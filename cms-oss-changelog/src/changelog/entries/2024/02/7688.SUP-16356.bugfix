Moving a page into another node will no longer be possible, if the page has variants in languages,
which are not activated in the target node. The only exception is when moving a page with a single language
into a node, that does not have languages at all (in this case, the page will also have no language) or when
moving a page without a language into a node with languages (the page will get the first assigned language
of the target node).
If a page is copied into another node, only the language variants with languages, which are activated in the
target node, will be copied. If no language variant of the page is activated in the target node, the selected
language variant will be copied and will get the first assigned language of the target node.
