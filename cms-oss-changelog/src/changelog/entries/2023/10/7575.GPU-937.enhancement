Adds WebP support for images. The Gentics Image Store now handles webp files correctly and activating the new feature "WebP Conversion":https://www.gentics.com/Content.Node/cmp8/guides/oss-feature_overview.html#webp-conversion will automatically convert uploaded image to WebP format for nodes which have the feature enabled. An "image conversion task":https://www.gentics.com/Content.Node/cmp8/guides/scheduler_api.html#convertimages has also been added which converts already existing non-WebP images to WebP format.
