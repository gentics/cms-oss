h2. Live URLs

This page will explain what this feature does.

h3. Enabling this feature in the configuration

The feature can either be activated globally (for all nodes):

<code>
feature:
	live_urls: true
</code>

or it can be activated as a "per node" feature:

<code>
feature:
	live_urls_per_node: true
</code>

When the feature is activated in the latter fashion, live URLs must be activated for each node over the "Features" entry in the node tree.

NOTE: If both "live_urls" and "live_urls_per_node" are activated, live URLs will be shown in every node.

h3. What does this feature do?

A small icon for live-URL is displayed after the page name in the page list, the image list and the file list.

When you hover with the mouse pointer over the icon, you will see the URL, the object (page, file or image) is assumed
to have, once it's published.
When you click on the icon, a new page will be opened with the live-URL.
If the object didn't get published yet, this will most likely lead to a 404-page on your webserver.

h3. How is the Live-URL generated?

The URL is built out of the following parts:

* Protocol - this can either be http:// or https://. You can enable this in the configuration of each Node in GCN.
* Host - the host can also be configured in the Node configuration.
* Publish path - this can be configured in the Node configuration and the configuration of each folder.
* Filename - the filename of the page, file or image.

h3. Does this work with content repositories?

Yes, this also works with CRs.
However, it's not guaranteed that the URL will be the same on the dynamic
web frontend once the page is published. It will use the host and publish directory as defined in the Node configuration.
