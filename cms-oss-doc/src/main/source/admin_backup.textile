  # stop Gentics CMS
  # dump the database
  mysqldump --max_allowed_packet=512M -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 42006 -p node_utf8 > /Node/tmp/node_utf8.sql
  # NOTE: You can decide if want to backup any contentrepositories
  # mysqldump --max_allowed_packet=512M -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 42006 -p contentrepository > /Node/tmp/cr.sql
</shell>

h3. File Backup

NOTE: This is the recommended way to backup your system

NOTE: Backup your database first

<shell>
# stop Gentics CMS
# create a full backup
tar cvfz /backup/Node-`date +%F`.tar.gz /Node
# start Gentics CMS
</shell>

# start Gentics CMS
</shell>
