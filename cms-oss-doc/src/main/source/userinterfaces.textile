h2. Editor and Administration User Interfaces

The Editor User Interface and the Administration User Interface are deliberately designed as two separate applications. They serve different target groups with different tasks and needs.
The Editor User Interface is designed for editors and content managers, respectively. Everything revolves around the content that you can dive into immediately and without any detours.
Projects, folders, pages, files and pictures are the main actors of the Editor User Interface.

Meanwhile, the Administration User Interface supports a wide range of target groups with partially overlapping tasks in all administrative matters related to the actual content.
