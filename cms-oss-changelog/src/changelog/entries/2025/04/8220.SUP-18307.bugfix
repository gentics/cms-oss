Editor User Interface: When publishing pages or taking pages offline, the messages shown to the user will
now be more explicit about whether the page has been immediately been written to or removed from the Content.Repository (when instant publishing is used)
or the page has just been set into the requested state (which will take effect with the next regular publish process).
