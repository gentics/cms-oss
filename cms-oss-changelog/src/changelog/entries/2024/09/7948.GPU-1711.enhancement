Page Expire Date: After taking a page in the CMS offline, the information of when it went offline is now available to the user.
Two new endpoints have been introduced to obtain this information

* @GET /publish/state/{type}/{objId}@
* @GET /publish/state/@

Additionally, a publish protocol of pages and forms has been added to the Editor User Interface.
