# Gentics CMS User Interface Monorepo

This mono repo contains all the user interfaces and libraries interacting with the CMS.
Management is done via [NX](https://nx.dev) but is also partially integrated with maven.

## Package repository settings

Authenticate:
```bash
npm adduser --registry=https://repo.apa-it.at/artifactory/api/npm/gtx-npm/ --always-auth
```

Setup @gentics scope to the APA IT repository:
```bash
npm config set @gentics:registry https://repo.apa-it.at/artifactory/api/npm/gtx-npm/
```

## Commands

Since this repo is managed via `nx`, all commands will end up be run via `nx` (See `scripts` inside of `package.json`).
Therefore, all commands can also be executed via [`nx run-many`](https://nx.dev/nx-api/nx/documents/run-many), to run them for multiple projects instead of one specific one.

All commands can be extended by passing flags to the underlying scripts. To do so, split the command with `--` then write the desired flags.
See [official documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-run-script).

```bash
npm {command} -- -f --flag=true
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start/Serve an application

**NX Command**: `serve`

Starts a development server for the project and will run on `localhost:4200` by default.

Be sure to configure the `proxy.conf.json` correctly first (See `proxy.conf.json.example`).

```bash
npm start <app-name>
```

### Unit-Tests

**NX Command**: `test`

Executes the Unit-Tests for the specified project

To run the unit tests and then terminate the test process:

```bash
npm test <app-name/lib-name>
```

To run the unit tests in watch mode (rebuild and rerun on every change):

```bash
npm run test <app-name/lib-name> -- --configuration=watch
```

**Available Configurations**:

* `watch`: To re-run the tests when source- or test-files have been edited/saved.
* `ci`: When run in a CI Server and includes test coverage reporting

### E2E/Integration Tests

**NX Command**: `e2e`

Starts the Cypress E2E/Integration tests with the specific e2e application (`{application-name}-e2e`).

```bash
npm run e2e <e2e-app-name>
```

### Components Tests

**NX Command**: `component-test`

Starts the Cypress Components tests for the specific application or library.

*Note*: When running multiple tests, disable `parallel` with `--parallel=false`, as it spawns a server for the tests which binds to a port.
When multiple try to run, it will fail due to the already bound port.


```bash
npm run component-test <app-name/lib-name>
```

**Available Configurations**:

* `watch`: To start the cypress UI and re-running the tests when source- or test-file have been edited/saved.
* `ci`: When run in a CI Server

### Build an application or library

**NX Command**: `build`

Builds the project and outputs ready to use/serve output files.

```bash
npm run build <app-name/lib-name>
```

**Available Configurations**:

* `production`: *Default*, production ready output
* `development`: Builds it with source-maps and non-optimized content to make debugging easier.
* `ci`: When run in a CI Server


## Tags

NX supports [tagging](https://nx.dev/nx-api/devkit/documents/ProjectConfiguration#tags) of all it's projects and being able to [filter the projects](https://nx.dev/nx-api/nx/documents/run-many) when running multiple commands.

Tags that are used in this Repository:

* `lib`: A library
* `models`: Only contains models/type defintions
* `angular`: Uses angular
* `publish`: Project which can be published
* `app`: An application
* `ui`: Main User-Interface/Standalone application
* `ct`: Custom-Tool which only works with/in the `editor-ui`
* `e2e`: End-to-End/Integration Test project
* `docs`: Documentation project to document one or more libraries/projects
* `demo`: Demo application to showcase the functionality of a library/project

### Structure

This repository using the Nx library together with Angular CLI. Therefore applications and libraries are separated into their dedicated folders `apps` and `libs`.

Custom TypeScript types are placed in the `typings` folder and can be included as other types with `tsconfig.json` files on package level or globally.

### Manage dependencies

There is only a single `package.json` file which contains all packages dependencies. This means if a package needs a new dependency it needs to be added to the root `package.json`.

Also updating these dependencies affects all packages, so after an update, they need to be tested and fixed on breaking changes.

Libraries having their own `package.json` only for packaging purposes, but it's not used for development or to build them.

### Add new application

These commands can be used to create new applications in the monorepo. It will generate the application structure and updates the repository configurations.

**Adds a new Angular application with Karma tests and Protractor e2e, using SCSS and Angular routing:**

```bash
npm run nx -- g @nx/angular:app <app-name> --routing --unit-test-runner=karma --e2e-test-runner=protractor --style=scss
```

### Add new library

These commands can be used to create new libraries in the monorepo. It will generate the library structure and updates the repository configurations.

**Adds a new Angular library with Karma tests, using SCSS:**

```bash
npm run nx -- g @nx/angular:lib <lib-name> --unit-test-runner=karma --style=scss
```

## Coding Style

-   Follow the rules defined by the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration where applicable.
-   Always use relative paths for TypeScript import statements if it's within the same project (in Visual Studio Code you can use the setting `"typescript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier": "relative"`).
    If it's from another package/library in this monorepo, simply refer to it with the official package name, i.E. `@gentics/cms-models`.
