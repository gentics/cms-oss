h2. How can I set the password of the node CMS user?

endprologue.



h3. Auto-generation

A password for the CMS user "node" will be generated automatically when the CMS is starting the first time.
The generated password will be logged to standard output.

Example:

<shell>
[localhost-startStop-1] INFO  com.gentics.contentnode.init.GenerateNodeUserPassword - A new password has been generated for the user "node": "2jk2nvsk4b34duojeis8d8v21k"
</shell>

h3. Setting initial password

The initial password can be set using the environtment variable @NODE_USER_PASSWORD@ or the Java system property @com.gentics.contentnode.node_user.password@. These settings only have an effect, when the password for the "node" user is not already set.
