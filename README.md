# Introduction

## Gentics CMP

Gentics CMP (Content Management Platform) is composed of the following components: Gentics CMS, Gentics Mesh, and Gentics Portal. Gentics CMS and Mesh are available as both open-source software (OSS) and Enterprise Edition (EE). Gentics Portal Java and PHP can only be acquired with the Enterprise Edition. You can find the EE features here: [Open-Source and Enterprise Edition](https://www.gentics.com/infoportal/cmp/ossandee/). For more information about the EE, please contact [sales@gentics.com](mailto:sales@gentics.com).

Here are the links to our open-source projects:

## Why pick Gentics CMS?

Gentics CMS is an integral part of the Gentics CMP and neccessary in order to create a functioning CMP. 
It is also the platform which provides a real WYSIWYG Editor, through which content can be easily edited.
You can use its modern user interface that makes content editing and administration enjoyable. You decide whether you want to
host it locally or in the cloud. We don’t care if you’re a Windows, Linux or
Mac guy or girl. Also, with its Apache 2.0 license, you are free to use it, modify
it and improve it.

What makes Gentics CMS special over other CMSes is:

* its built-in user management not only covers the admin and editor features,
  but can also be used for handling access to your application.
* it thinks in content trees (just like websites do), which brings you many
  things for free: automatic navigation menus, automatic beautiful URLs,
  built-in link resolving, …​
* it is scalable and built for clustering, so your deployment can grow with
  your project’s success.
