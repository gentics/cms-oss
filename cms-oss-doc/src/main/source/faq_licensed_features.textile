h3. Workflow

Licensed Features like "Multichannelling Content.Repositories":https://www.gentics.com/Content.Node/cmp8/guides/mc_contentrepository.html and the Template/Tagtype "Migration Tool":https://www.gentics.com/Content.Node/cmp8/guides/feature_migration.html must be activated.
First the feature needs to be added to the license key. This can be done by sending a license activation request to __license@gentics.com__.
The license key file needs to be updated after the license request has been granted. Remove the activation information from the keyfile.

* license.key:
<shell>
1234-5678-9123-4567-8912-3456-7890-1234
6314E8EE755209DD58ADB65A018DD81C
302C02141FC3E44CEE28EEE83EABBAFF376BC77E1CE02C5C02147E773456A1F93F1B3C4A09C928E96C1EAF4EFC89
CN
</shell>

* Change to:
<shell>
1234-5678-9123-4567-8912-3456-7890-1234
</shell>

After this step Gentics CMS needs to be restarted. The restart will invoke a reactivation of the license key. After the activation has been completed the license key file should look similar to this:

<shell>
1234-5678-9123-4567-8912-3456-7890-1234
6314E8EE755209DD58ADB65A018DD81C
302C02141FC3E44CEE28EEE83EABBAFF376BC77E1CE02C5C02147E773456A1F93F1B3C4A09C928E96C1EAF4EFC89
CN, TTM, MCCR
</shell>

The last line of the license key should now contain the licensed feature information.
