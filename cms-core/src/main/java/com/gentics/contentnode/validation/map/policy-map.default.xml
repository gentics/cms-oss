<!-- 
	** Important Note **
	
	Customers may define their own policy-map. No incompatible changes to the
	schema schould be made (schema should only be extended) to avoid the customer's
	policy map to break. Any significant changes should be documented in the Gentics
	Content Node changelog.

	Also, there is an example policy-map documented in the infoportal (article about the
	"validation" feature) , which should be updated to reflect any changes made here.
	
	** Important Note **
	
	If any changes to the policies defined in the custom policy-map
	are made (in the policies section), the policy URI must be changed
	to a customer specific URI. Otherwise, there may be problems with
	Import/Export.

			Policy definitions.
		
			Ids should start with lower-case to distinguish them from policy
			groups (share the same namespace).
		
			The policy URI is used to refer to the policy from outside the document
			(the id is only used within the document).
		
			The URI attribute can be any arbitrary URI, but should point
			to a resource located on a domain that is owned by the
			defining entity - these URIs are transmitted through
			import/export of tag-types, and should not clash with URIs
			of policies not under the defining entity's control.
		
			If a policy definition for a policy URI doesn't exist on a foreign
			system, a default policy will be used, which is usually more
			constraining than the actual policy definition. 

			It does not constitute an error, if a policy definition exist
			on a foreign system, that differs from the local definition with
			the same URI. (the policy definition on the foreign system will
			be used since policy definitions are not automatically transmitted
			through import/export, only the URI is).
			
			The URI must not be used for more than one unique policy definition
			at a time, and the purpose of the policy should be reflected in the
			URI.
			
			Additionally, the URI must not be longer than 255 characters.
			
			Other common settings:
			* id the XMLID that is used to refer to the policy withing this
			  document.
			* displayName the internationalization key. must be all lowercase.

			The antiSamy policy uses AntiSamy for validation.
			
			* policyFile if provided, a relative or absolute URL to the AntiSamy
			  policy file. If not provided, the default policy file bundled with
			  the application is used.
			* domeMode defaults to false. It is not recommended to change this
			  default. AntiSamy provides two modes of operation, SAX mode and
			  DOM mode. DOM mode seems to be a little cleverer than SAX mode
			  but assumes HTML input and doesn't work with <node> tags.
			* outerElement defaults to <div>. Input text is always considered
			  a document fragment, that is, it may have multiple root nodes.
			  This option allows one, for the purpose of validation, to define
			  an outer element that provides a context node that the input text
			  is validated in. The default should not restrict the validation in
			  any way.
