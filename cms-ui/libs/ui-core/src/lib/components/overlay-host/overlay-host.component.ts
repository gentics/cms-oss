/**
 * The OverlayHost is required to display any kind of overlay component such as a modal or
 * [toast notification](#/notification). It represents the location in the DOM into which new overlays
 * will be loaded. As such it should be at or close to the root of your app (i.e. a direct
 * child of your App's root component). There should only be one OverlayHost in your app.
 *
 * There are no attributes to configure nor events to listen to - all interaction with this
 * component happens via the `OverlayHostService`, which allows other components to grab a
 * reference (`ViewContainerRef`) to the OverlayHost DOM element and then insert components or elements
 * at that location.
 *
 * ```html
 * <gtx-overlay-host></gtx-overlay-host>
 * ```
