In cases where a scheduler execution finished (successful or with an error) during unavailability of the
backend database the execution could not be marked as finished. This caused the scheduler to no start any
more executions until the CMS was restartet.
The behaviour has been improved so that the scheduler will no mark the execution as finished as soon as the
backend database is available.
