    ** Bad: "Software crashes"
* Add information about used software. (e.g: Internet Explorer 9.x, Gentics CMS Version 5.14.3)
* Write precise steps to reproduce the problem.
    ** What happened and what did you expect to happen?
    ** Add Screenshots/Screencasts if possible.
    ** Add pageIds when pages are affected.
* On which system did the problem occur? [System URL/Name]
* License key of the installation.
* __[Optional]__ Add a regression window. When did the bug first appear?
