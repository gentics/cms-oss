h3. Velocity Part Type

An example for this tag part type can be found within the demo server in the folder "Demo-CMS-Projekt/Home/Node Tags".

* Parameter "template"
* Type: HTML lang
* Content: The Velocity Template Code that should be rendered by the visible Velocity Part Type.

* Parameter "macros":
* Type: HTML lang
* Content: VTL Macros which can be used within the implementation.

Example Velocity Tagtyp:

* Part 1: Typ Velocity, Keyword vtl, Visible
* Part 2: Typ HTML lang, Keyword template, Not visible
* Part 3: Typ HTML lang, Keyword macros, Not visible

Errors within the velocity implementation will be diplayed within the Gentics CMS im "error stream".

NOTE: Use always the __.toString()__ method when comparing two tags within a __#if()__ command.

Example:

<shell>
#if( $cms.page.object.myprop.toString() == "test" )
</shell>

h3. Custom Part Type Implementations

Custom part types can be created using the AbstractExtensiblePartType class.

To use extensible parttypes you need to insert a row into the type table of the cms database.
Please note that once the row has been inserted, any changes to the row, such as updating
the class name, require a CMS restart (the part type information is cached internally).

To avoid id conflicts please calculate your personal id range for now:
 * Take the 1st 4 characters of one of the customers cms license keys.
 * Convert them from hex to dec.
 * Multiply by 1000. this is the lowest allowed id.
 * Add 999. thid is the highest allowed id.
 * E.g: license key is A2B4-xxxx-xxxx...
 * HEX a2b4 is 41652 in decimal.
 * Your personal id range is 41652000 - 41652999.
