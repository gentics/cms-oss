When a node published into a Content.Repository with instant publishing enabled, operations which modified objects that should be published into the
Content.Repository would fail with an internal server error, if the Content.Repository was currently not available or improperly set up.
This has been fixed. While instant publishing itself will not be possible in such cases, the originating operation will succeed now.
