When publishing into a Mesh CR with instant publishing enabled, it could happen that objects, which were published and then deleted into the wastebin
between two regular publish runs where not removed from Mesh. This could lead to conflicts during subsequent publish runs, if objects with the same publish
path should be published afterwards.
This has been fixed.
