h3. How to write a ticket

The following guidelines can be used to enhance your ticket with additional and useful information.

* Write a clear subject:
    ** Good: "Cancelling a File Copy dialog crashes File Manager"
    ** Bad: "Software crashes"
* Add information about used software. (e.g: Firefox 134, Gentics CMS Version 6.3.5)
* Write precise steps to reproduce the problem.
    ** What happened and what did you expect to happen?
    ** Add Screenshots/Screencasts if possible.
    ** Add pageIds when pages are affected.
* On which system did the problem occur? [System URL/Name]
* License key of the installation.
* __[Optional]__ Add a regression window. When did the bug first appear?

The ticket can be send via email to __servicedesk [at] jira-gentics [dot] atlassian [dot] net__ or created via our "ticket tracker system":https://support.gentics.com.
