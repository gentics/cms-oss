WARNING: Doing backups is *not* part of Gentics CMS - doing backups is part of
each customer's liability.

WARNING: Backing up database tables while Gentics CMS is up and
running will most certainly lead to data inconsistencies.

WARNING: The following steps may vary, depending on your system. Please adapt
your steps accordingly.


h3. Database Backup

Create a backup of your MySQL database.

<shell>
  # stop Gentics CMS
  # dump the database
  mysqldump --max_allowed_packet=512M -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -p node_utf8 > /Node/tmp/node_utf8.sql
</shell>

h3. File Backup

NOTE: Backup your database first

<shell>
# stop Gentics CMS
# create a full backup
tar cvfz /backup/cms-data-`date +%F`.tar.gz /cms/data
# start Gentics CMS
</shell>

h4. Differential Backup

NOTE: Backup your database first

The @rdiff-backup@ "package":https://github.com/rdiff-backup/rdiff-backup#installation can be used to create incremental backups of the CMS data.

<shell>
# stop Gentics CMS
# create backup using rdiff-backup
rdiff-backup /cms/ /backup/cms
# start Gentics CMS
</shell>
