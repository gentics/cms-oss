When publishing into a Mesh Content.Repository with the setting "Publish Directory Segments" enabled,
and some properties of folders were translated into languages other than English it was possible to not also translate
the Publish Directory Segment, which subsequently caused errors in the publish process.
The behaviour has been changed so that translation of the Publish Directory Segment is also enforced and the translations are
made unique.
