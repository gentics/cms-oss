h2. Always localize

If you try to edit an inherited object in a channel, Gentics CMS will normally ask you if you want to edit the inherited object or create a localized copy and edit the copy. Sometimes it is more convenient to skip this dialogue and always create a localized copy instead. This feature accommodates for that situation.

h3. Configuration

If you want to use this feature, you first have to enable it globally in your node.conf

<shell filename="conf/features.yml>
feature:
  always_localize: true
</shell>

After that, you can enable it per node in the nodes' "Features" dialogues (which can be found either in a node's context menu or in Node â€“ Features).
