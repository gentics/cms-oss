endprologue.

h3. Pre Requirements

* "System Requirements":faq_system_requirements.html
* All commands have to be executed using the root user.
* Make sure the locale en_US.UTF-8 is generated
* Make sure your timezone is correctly set (eg. to CET)

h4. Download the package

Download the Gentics CMS JAR from our Maven repository:

# OSS version: https://maven.gentics.com/maven2/com/gentics/cms-oss/cms-oss-server
# Enterprise version: https://maven.gentics.com/maven2/com/gentics/cms/cms-server

Save the JAR file under /cms.

h4. Create service

Create the systemd service file:

<shell filename="/cms/cms.service">
[Unit]
Description=Gentics CMS
Wants=basic.target
After=basic.target network.target syslog.target

[Service]
User=node
Restart=on-failure
ExecStart=java -Duser.dir=/cms -Dcom.gentics.contentnode.config.files=cms -cp cms-oss-server.jar com.gentics.contentnode.server.Runner
WorkingDirectory=/ms
LimitMEMLOCK=infinity
LimitNOFILE=65536
LimitAS=infinity
LimitRSS=infinity
LimitCORE=infinity

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</shell>

Create the configuration .yml files under /cms/conf/cms and activate the service with
<shell>
# systemctl enable /cms/cms.service
</shell>

h4. Database server

When using the debian package installer with MariaDB, this step will be done automatically.

Please install a "compatible":gcn_compatibility_list.html MySQL Server on your system.
We suggest a installation of MariaDB on the same server that will host Gentics CMS.

The following mysql permissions are needed.

<shell>
  mysql> GRANT usage ON *.* to node_cms@HOSTNAME;
  mysql> GRANT super ON *.* to node_cms@HOSTNAME;
  mysql> GRANT all ON node_utf8.* to node_cms@HOSTNAME;
  mysql> GRANT all ON node_utf8_cr.* to node_cms@HOSTNAME;
  mysql> GRANT all ON node_utf8_todo.* to node_cms@HOSTNAME;
</shell>

The following mysql custom settings are mandatory. (MariaDB / MySQL 5.7)
<shell>
[mysqld]
  innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2
  character-set-server           = utf8mb4
  character_set_client           = utf8
  character-set-filesystem       = utf8

  sql_mode                       = ""
  innodb                         = FORCE
  default-storage-engine         = InnoDB
  max_allowed_packet             = 256M
  collation_server               = utf8_general_ci

[client]
  default-character-set          = utf8
</shell>

h3. Migration

See the "migration guide":admin_migration_cmp8.html for information about migrating from CMP 7.x to CMP 8.x.

h4. Final recommendations and suggestions

IMPORTANT: It is mandatory to adjust the "memory settings":faq_memory_performance_settings.html for your installation. Not doing so can lead to performance issues.

NOTE: It's considered best practice to use hyphens (-) instead of underscores (<notextile>_</notextile>) in URL's. For new installations you should add "these settings":feature_sanitize_name.html#using-hyphens-instead-of-underscores to your configuration.

h4. Resetting the database

The database of the Gentics CMS can by reset anytime by dropping & recreating the database:

<shell>
mysql> DROP database node_utf8;
mysql> CREATE database node_utf8;
</shell>

The database structure will be recreated during the next startup of Gentics CMS.
