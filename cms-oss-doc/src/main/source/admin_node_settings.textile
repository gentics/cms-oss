h2. Node specific settings

Custom settings can be configured per node and loaded via the REST API.

h3. Setting and retrieving custom settings

Node specific settings can be configured via the variable @node_settings@ using either the local ID or global ID or name of the node:
<shell filename="conf/*.yml">
node_settings:
  '3D6C.bbcc391e-ae22-11e9-9f0d-00155df0382f':
    resizing:
      aspect_ratios:
		- '4:3'
		- '16:10'
	  max_height: 500
);
</shell>
The settings can be retrieved via the REST API with requests to the @/rest/node/[NODEID]/settings@ endpoint. In the resulting
"JSON response":https://www.gentics.com/Content.Node/guides/restapi/json_NodeSettingsResponse.html the configuration will be in
the field @data@. With the configuration above, a request to @/rest/node/1/settings@ would yield:
<javascript>
{
	"messages": [],
	"responseInfo": {
		"responseCode": "OK",
		"responseMessage": "Loaded settings for Node {1}"
	},
	"data": {
		"resizing": {
			"aspect_ratios": [
				"4:3",
				"16:10"
			],
			"max_height": 500
		}
	}
}
</javascript>

h3. Global values

Global settings for all nodes can be configured in the variable @node_settings_global@. All entries in this array will be
added to the node specific settings unless they already contain that setting.

*NOTE:* that the value types for settings must match in the global and node specific settings. For example a global array value
cannot be overriden with a numeric value.

Loading settings for nodes without specific settings will just return the global settings.

For example the configuration

<shell filename="conf/*.yml">
node_settings_global:
  resizing:
    max_height: 500
    allowh_this: false

node_settings:
  "1":
    resizing:
      aspect_ratios:
        - "4:3"
        - "16:10"
</shell>

would result in the following response from @/rest/node/1/settings@ (note that the configuration for node 1 only contains
the aspect ratios, the rest comes from the global settings):

<javascript>
{
	"messages": [],
	"responseInfo": {
		"responseCode": "OK",
		"responseMessage": "Loaded settings for Node {1}"
	},
	"data": {
		"allow_this": false,
		"resizing": {
			"aspect_ratios": [
				"4:3",
				"16:10"
			],
			"max_height": 500
		}
	}
}
</javascript>
