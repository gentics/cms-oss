When importing a devtool package from the filesystem to the CMS, the pages of templates contained in the devtool package
will no longer be synchronized with the template during the process.
The synchronization must either be done using the "Tag Status" tab of the template properties in the Administration User Interface,
or by using the UpdateImplementation tool.
