Execution of external tasks in the scheduler has been improved: stdout and stderr of the executed command (script)
will now not be buffered, but will be redirected to log files. This fixes problems with commands that create lots of output (e.g. curl, if the request runs for a long time),
which could cause some executions to hang forever.
Additionally, the display of scheduler executions has been improved:
* Running scheduler tasks will now be shown as "Running" (instead of "Failed")
* Running scheduler tasks will now show the current duration instead of 0
